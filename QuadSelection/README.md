# Quadrant Selection

A common problem in mathematics is to determine\
which quadrant a given point lies in. There are\
four quadrants, numbered from 1 to 4, as shown\
in the diagram below:

For example, the point A, which is at coordinates\
(12,5) lies in quadrant 1 since both its x and y\
values are positive, and point B lies in quadrant\
2 since its x value is negative and its y value is\
positive.

Your job is to take a point and determine the quadrant\
it is in. You can assume that neither of the two\
coordinates will be 0.

# Input
The first line of input contains the integer\
x (−1000≤x≤1000;x≠0). The second line of input contains\
the integer y (−1000≤y≤1000;y≠0).

# Program Output

```
QuadSelection$ ./exe 
Please enter (x, y) values (Respectively): 1 1
Points (1, 1) lie in the quadrant: 1

QuadSelection$ ./exe 
Please enter (x, y) values (Respectively): 1 -1
Points (1, -1) lie in the quadrant: 4

QuadSelection$ ./exe 
Please enter (x, y) values (Respectively): -1 1
Points (-1, 1) lie in the quadrant: 2

QuadSelection$ ./exe 
Please enter (x, y) values (Respectively): -1 -1
Points (-1, -1) lie in the quadrant: 3
